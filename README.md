# Responsive Muffins!

A fictional muffin store's site, created to explore responsive design.
Site is designed for phone, tablet and desktop.

## Responsive design techniques used include:
- Picturefill
- Media queries
- Bootstrap responsive design classes
- Use of % and em measures instead of absolutes where possible
- SVG image format for logo

## A few of my learnings:
1. I learned a lot about retina images for mobile, and how to simulate a site in Google Dev Tools.

2. Hover state doesn't apply to tablet and phone! Made sense after I thought about it!

3. Learned a lot about standards for tablet and phone, ie collapsing the nav bar to a hamburger menu, making buttons large for fingers, and planning images and content well (and ensuring content is absolutely necessary).

4. Also learned about customizing Bootstrap! I looked into changing the breakpoint at which the hamburger menu collapses by changing the @grid-float-breakpoint: from @screen-sm-min; to @screen-md-min; in order to get it to break at a higher pixel width, but I just really needed to decrease the padding of the navbar's <li>s in order to solve the problem. I also learned a lot about Bootstrap's responsive classes, and how they react with the breakpoints.
